This is the Barhan online-store, created by myself.
This is multi-page application, so it was wrote without some of web-frameworks (such as Angular or React).
In this project I used Node.js, Express.js for server-side; Mongoose for MongoDB database; EJS as template engine; HTML, CSS, SASS, some Javascript files for client-side.
Online-cart realized through locale storage.


To use project you need:
1. Command "npm install"
2. Run MongoDB
3. Run command "node index"
4. The server will be listening on port 3000
